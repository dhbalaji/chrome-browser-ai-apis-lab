# üß† Chrome Browser AI APIs Lab

**Where Chrome flexes its [AI muscles](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai).**  
An experimental playground for Chrome‚Äôs built-in AI APIs ‚Äî language detection, summarization, image tricks, and whatever shiny thing Google sneaks into Beta next. We toggle flags, break stuff, and learn fast.

### üí¨ Few things I have to say

- ‚öôÔ∏è Things are **moving fast... and slow** in Chrome land.  
- üåê Most APIs here are **Chrome-only**, sorry Firefox fam.  
- üíª Your **laptop might just give up** if the hardware isn‚Äôt AI-friendly.  
- üß© I try to write **production-grade examples**, not just console.log magic.  
- üíô Assumes you speak **TypeScript** and vibe with **intermediate JS APIs**.
- üîî You might need **Chrome Beta** and a few `chrome://flags` flips.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Setup & Run

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhbalaji/chrome-browser-ai-apis-lab.git
   cd chrome-browser-ai-apis-lab
   ```
2. Enable experimental flags (if needed): Go to chrome://flags
   Search and enable AI-related flags (depends on API)

3. Run your experiments: scripts vary based on the repo and you know how to work with `npm`, our mighty nodejs package manager

4. Use a recent LTS Node (recommended).

5. Bring curiosity, not a binge-watch mindset.
